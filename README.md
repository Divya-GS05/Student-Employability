# Student-Employability
This app helps evaluate student employability based on their skills and attributes. Using Gradio for the user interface and models like Logistic Regression or Perceptron, it predicts if a student is "Employable" or needs improvement. The app takes ratings on key skills — like communication, confidence, and alertness — and gives instant feedback.
